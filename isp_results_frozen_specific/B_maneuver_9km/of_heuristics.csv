N2O/ETHANOL,N2O,ETHANOL,1,0.05,8.0,5.0,7.0,"N2O/ethanol bipropellant and hybrid tests often choose O/F values between 5 and 7, straddling stoichiometric while limiting wall heat flux."
H2O2/RP-1,H2O2,RP-1,1,0.05,8.0,6.0,8.0,"High-test peroxide with kerosene is usually operated close to stoichiometric, around O/F 6–8, slightly fuel rich for materials and stability margins."
